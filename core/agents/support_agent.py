SupportAgent
============

This module defines a placeholder support agent for handling customer
service requests.  It demonstrates how additional agent modules can be
added to the Ajax system.  At this stage it echoes the task and notes
that customer support functionality is not yet implemented.  A real
implementation might integrate with helpâ€‘desk software or FAQ
databases.
