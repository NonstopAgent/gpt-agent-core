FanpageAgent
============

This module defines a placeholder fanpage agent responsible for
managing social media fan pages (e.g. TikTok or Instagram).  At the
moment it simply echoes the task and indicates that social posting
capabilities are not yet implemented.  Future versions could draft
captions, schedule posts, or generate engagement reports.
