GrowthAgent
===========

The GrowthAgent is a placeholder responsible for analysing social
media growth, suggesting content strategies, and drafting captions
or calls to action.  Currently it echoes the task and notes that
growth analysis is not yet implemented.  In future iterations this
agent could tap into analytics APIs and machine learning models to
optimise reach and engagement.
