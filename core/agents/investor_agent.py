InvestorAgent
=============

This module defines a placeholder investor agent.  It currently echoes
the requested task and notes that the stock research functionality has
not yet been implemented.  In a future iteration this agent could
integrate with financial APIs to analyse stocks, generate trading
recommendations, and evaluate investment opportunities.
